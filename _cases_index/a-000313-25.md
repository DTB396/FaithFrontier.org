overview: >
  This is an Appellate Division matter stemming from a municipal street-crossing enforcement encounter in Atlantic County, New Jersey, and the resulting conviction. The appeal concerns the legality and procedural handling of the stop, subsequent enforcement actions, and post-conviction consequences. According to the appellant’s asserted record, the initiating officer activated emergency lights and demanded identification while stating that no citation would be issued. The matter later resulted in a street-crossing conviction and multiple subsequent arrests attributed to a summons that was allegedly never properly served. These issues are raised and addressed through the appellate process and associated filings.

### Scope and Integrity Rules (Faith Frontier Standard)

- **Primary sources control.** Where a summary conflicts with an order, notice, filing stamp, or docket entry, the primary source controls and the summary must be corrected.

- **Neutral tone.** This archive preserves claims and positions as asserted, while labeling them as assertions unless adjudicated.
