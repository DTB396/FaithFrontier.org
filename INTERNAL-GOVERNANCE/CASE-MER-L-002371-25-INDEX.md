## Appendix: How to Contract and Persuade a Lawyer for Contingency Representation

### 1. Understand Contingency Fee Arrangements
- The lawyer is paid a percentage (often 25–40%) of any recovery (settlement or judgment). If you lose, you pay nothing for attorney fees (but may owe costs).
- Common in civil rights, personal injury, employment, and some consumer cases.

### 2. What Lawyers Look For in Contingency Cases
- Strong merits: clear facts, strong legal theory, and evidence.
- Damages: significant, provable financial or personal harm.
- Collectability: defendant has assets or insurance to pay a judgment.
- Client credibility: organized, honest, and reliable client.
- Efficiency: well-documented case, with filings and evidence ready.

### 3. How to Present Your Case
- Organize everything: provide a summary, timeline, key documents, and evidence (as in this report).
- Highlight merits: emphasize legal strengths, clear violations, and supporting law.
- Show damages: quantify losses and ongoing harm.
- Demonstrate collectability: show the defendant can pay if you win.
- Be professional: respect the lawyer’s time, be concise, and responsive.

### 4. How to Persuade a Strong Attorney
- Be upfront: state you seek contingency representation and why.
- Show preparation: present your case package (summary, filings, evidence, status reports).
- Emphasize impact: note public interest, potential for precedent, or media attention if relevant.
- Offer cooperation: make clear you’ll assist with evidence, deadlines, and communication.
- Ask for referrals: if declined, ask if they know another attorney or firm who might take the case.

### 5. Contracting Best Practices
- Get a written agreement: the contingency fee agreement must be in writing, stating the percentage, costs, and what happens if you lose.
- Clarify costs: understand who pays court costs, expert fees, and other expenses.
- Review terms: make sure you understand and agree to all terms before signing.
