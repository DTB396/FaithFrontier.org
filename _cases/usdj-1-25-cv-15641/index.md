## Case Overview

This federal civil action is brought by Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** against municipal officers, supervisors, and governmental entities, including the Township of Hamilton and Atlantic County. The Complaint asserts claims under **42 U.S.C. § 1983**, the **New Jersey Civil Rights Act**, and related constitutional doctrines.

The action arises from alleged unlawful police conduct, including warrantless seizure, excessive force, fabrication or escalation of charges, and subsequent due-process violations during detention and prosecution. Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages (where permitted), as well as declaratory and narrowly tailored injunctive relief.

## Core Issues Presented

* Whether defendants violated the **Fourth Amendment** through unlawful seizure and excessive force;
* Whether charges were fabricated or escalated without probable cause in violation of due process;
* Whether supervisory and municipal defendants are liable under **Monell** for policies, customs, or failures to train;
* Whether declaratory or prospective injunctive relief is necessary to prevent ongoing or future violations.

---

## Procedural Posture

* **9 Sep 2025:** Complaint, jury demand, and accompanying motions (including preservation and early-production requests) submitted to the District of New Jersey.
* **September 2025:** Application to proceed *in forma pauperis* filed, requesting service by the U.S. Marshals upon approval.
* **Ongoing:** Initial screening, service determinations, and scheduling remain pending before the Court.
