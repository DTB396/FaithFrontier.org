---

### Nature of the Action

This is an **emergent civil action** seeking immediate injunctive and equitable relief under **R. 4:52-1** and **R. 4:67-1**. Plaintiff challenges the seizure and continued retention of his **2019 Volkswagen Passat (NJ Plate F35VLP)**, which was taken and held without statutory authority, court order, forfeiture process, or constitutionally adequate due process.

---

### Core Facts

* On **November 29, 2025**, Hamilton Township police officers seized Plaintiff’s vehicle following a traffic stop and custodial arrest.
* The arrest resulted in municipal-level charges (including disorderly conduct, obstruction, and resisting arrest), **none of which authorize vehicle impoundment** under Title 39 or any forfeiture statute.
* The vehicle was **operable, legally parked, not contraband, not evidence, and posed no public-safety hazard** at the time of seizure.
* **No forfeiture complaint, warrant, inventory, or judicial order** has ever been issued authorizing continued retention of the vehicle.
* The **Atlantic County Prosecutor’s Office confirmed in writing** that it possesses **no 911 call, CAD entry, dispatch record, or call-for-service documentation** supporting either the stop or the impoundment.
* Defendants have refused to release the vehicle unless towing and storage fees are paid, despite the impoundment being **unlawful ab initio**.

These facts are set forth in sworn certifications and a verified complaint filed with the Court.

---

### Legal Theories Asserted

The action alleges ongoing violations of:

* **The Fourth Amendment** and **N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 7** (unreasonable seizure and continued retention of property);
* **Procedural due process** under the Fourteenth Amendment and New Jersey law (absence of notice, hearing, or lawful basis);
* New Jersey impoundment and inventory law requiring **statutory authority or standardized, non-discretionary caretaking criteria** (including *State v. One 1990 Honda Accord*, *State v. Mangold*, and *State v. Edmonds*).

Plaintiff further alleges that **towing and storage fees may not lawfully be imposed** where the underlying seizure lacked legal authority.

---

### Emergent Harm

Plaintiff is a **licensed tradesman** who relies on the vehicle for:

* transportation to and from employment;
* access to tools and work equipment;
* housing stability and basic daily needs.

Continued retention has caused **immediate and irreparable harm**, including loss of income, inability to access essential property, exposure to escalating fees imposed on an indigent litigant, and time-sensitive loss of stored personal and business property. These circumstances satisfy the **Crowe v. De Gioia** standard for temporary restraints and emergent relief.

---

### Procedural Posture

* A **Verified Complaint, Order to Show Cause with Temporary Restraints, supporting certifications, brief, and proposed forms of order** were filed on **December 7, 2025** via JEDS.
* Plaintiff has also pursued related **municipal-court relief**, served formal discovery requests under **R. 7:7-7**, and issued preservation demands and an Internal Affairs complaint.
* The matter is presented as an **accelerated civil action** requiring prompt judicial intervention to halt ongoing constitutional and equitable violations.

---

### Relief Requested

Plaintiff seeks orders:

1. Directing the **immediate return** of the vehicle;
2. Declaring the impoundment and continued retention **unlawful**;
3. Prohibiting the assessment or collection of towing and storage fees;
4. Compelling production and preservation of all impound-related documents, logs, and recordings; and
5. Granting such other equitable relief as the Court deems just.
