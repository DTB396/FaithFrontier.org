## Case Overview

This Law Division action is brought by Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** against **John W. Tumelty, Esq.** and **The Law Offices of John W. Tumelty**. The case arises from Defendants’ alleged failure to perform agreed legal services after accepting a retainer in connection with Plaintiff’s pretrial detention and related criminal proceedings.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants abandoned representation, failed to communicate, failed to pursue available pretrial remedies, and retained fees without providing contracted services. The action asserts multiple independent causes of action sounding in contract, tort, and statute, rather than a single malpractice theory alone.
