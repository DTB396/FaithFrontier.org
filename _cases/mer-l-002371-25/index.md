## Case Overview

This Law Division action is brought by Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** against the **New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC)**. The case challenges the legality and constitutionality of MVC license-suspension and enforcement actions allegedly imposed without adequate notice, meaningful opportunity to be heard, or reliable administrative recordkeeping.

Plaintiff alleges that MVC actions resulted in ongoing deprivation of driving privileges and collateral consequences without compliance with fundamental procedural safeguards required by the New Jersey Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment, and governing administrative law principles.

---

## Core Issues Presented

* Whether MVC provided constitutionally sufficient **notice and opportunity to be heard** prior to suspension or enforcement action;
* Whether MVC administrative records accurately reflected Plaintiff’s status and proceedings;
* Whether continued enforcement based on defective or incomplete records violates due process;
* Whether declaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to prevent ongoing and future harm.

---

## Procedural Posture

* **14 Nov 2025:** Verified Complaint filed in the Law Division, Mercer County, with supporting certifications and exhibits.
* **November–December 2025:** Plaintiff submitted supplemental filings and correspondence addressing indigency, enforcement consequences, and the need for prompt judicial review.
* **Ongoing:** Matter remains active; responsive pleadings, scheduling, and any motions practice are pending.

## Relief Requested

Plaintiff seeks:

1. Declaratory relief determining the legality of MVC suspension and enforcement practices as applied;
2. Injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement absent constitutionally adequate process;
3. Orders directing correction and completion of MVC administrative records;
4. Such other equitable relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.
