## Git Status Note

**IMPORTANT:** The site has merge conflict markers in YAML files from previous repair attempts. These need to be resolved before the site will build:

**Files affected:**
- `_data/docket/*.yml` (multiple files)

**To resolve:**
1. Run the conflict resolution script: `node scripts/resolve-docket-conflicts.js`
2. Or manually remove merge markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Fix double `/assets/assets/` paths to single `/assets/`

**The new stewardship pages are NOT affected** by these conflicts and are ready to use once YAML issues are resolved.
